This library contains classes that are related to ODF but which are
not used by any application or by any library in libs/. Most of the
time this means that the classes are used by the filters, which is the
reason why this library is placed here.

The classes are so far comprised of the following categories:
 - Text contents objects: KoTable, KoRow, KoColumn, KoCell, ...
 - style objects: Kostyle, Ko*Style.

The reason why the applications are not using them is often that these
classes are pure storage classes and the applications have more
advanced implementations that allow editing with good performance.
Examples of such classes are style classes and objects that are part
of text contents.

If a class is interesting to use in an application it should be moved
to libs/odf.
