     * dab in a paint op, filling the selection in the Fill Tool.
     * Such work is usually done in the following way:
     *
     * 1) Create a paint device
     *
     * 2) Fill it with the desired color or data
     *
     * 3) Create a KisPainter and set all the properties of the
     *    trasaction: selection, compositeOp, opacity and etc.
     *
     * 4) Paint a newly created paint device over the destination
     *    device.
     *
     * The following two methods (createCompositionSourceDevice() or
     * createCompositionSourceDeviceFixed())should be used for the
     * accomplishing the step 1). The point is that the desired color
     * space of the temporary device may not coincide with the color
     * space of the destination. That is the case, for example, for
     * the alpha8() colorspace used in the selections. So for such
     * devices the temporary target would have a different (grayscale)
     * color space.
     *
     * So there are two rules of thumb:
     *
     * 1) If you need a temporary device which you are going to fill
     *    with some data and then paint over the paint device, create
     *    it with either createCompositionSourceDevice() or
     *    createCompositionSourceDeviceFixed().
     *
     * 2) Do *not* expect that the color spaces of the destination and
     *    the temporary device would coincide. If you need to copy a
     *    single pixel from one device to another, you can use
     *    KisCrossDeviceColorPicker class, that will handle all the
