/**
 * \brief Abstract base class for input actions.
 *
 * Input actions represent actions to be performed when interacting
 * with the canvas. They are managed by KisInputManager and activated
 * when KisKeyShortcut or KisStrokeShortcut detects it matches a certain
 * set of inputs.
 *
 * The begin() method uses an index for the type of behaviour to activate.
 * This index can be used to trigger behaviour when different events occur.
 *
 * The events can be of two types:
 * 1) Key events. The input manager calls begin() and end() sequentially
 *    with an \p index parameter to begin() representing the type of
 *    action that should be performed. The \p event parameter of both
 *    calls in null.
 * 2) Stroke events. The input manager calls begin() and end() on the
 *    corresponding mouse down and up events. The \p event parameter
 *    will be of QMouseEvent type, representing the event happened.
 *    All the mouse move events between begin() and end() will be
 *    redirected to the inputEvent() method.
 *
 *    You can fetch the QTabletEvent data for the current mouse event
 *    with inputManager()->lastTabletEvent().
