---------------- Milestone 1: merge with master ----------------


Annoyances
----------
 * after inserting a comment the annotationshape should be active

 * when clicking esc inside an annotation the cursor should return to the original textshape

 * The background of the annotation area should be more neutral in color

 * Save and load status of "Show Comments".

 * Zoom to Page Width should include the annotation area if active.

 * The review tool's annotation widget should have icons rather than text buttons .

 * Setting of "Show comments" also available in the review tool?


More work
---------

 * Load more attributes, especially the styles.

 * roundtrip tests

 * different layout when printing with comments

 * Annotations to the left for people who use RTL languages.


Ideas
-----

 * Use color coding for different authors
   (This is probably already possible through the styles)
